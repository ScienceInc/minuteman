**conanbatt:** anyone here knows some good web app metrics tool ?

**conanbatt:** i use google analytics for the page itself, and its good, but for the webapp its really not useful

**tizoc: conanbatt:** http://amix.dk/blog/post/19714 you can port this (if an equivalent doesn't exist already)

**conanbatt:** the metrics link is excellent but its python and released 5 days ago lol

**elcuervo: tizoc:** the idea it's awesome

**elcuervo:** interesting...
